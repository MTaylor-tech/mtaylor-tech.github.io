                <h2 class="uncial-antiqua-regular">Bagpiper for Funerals and Memorial Services and other occasions</h2>
                <p>I provide traditional bagpipe music for funerals, memorials, and graveside services throughout West Virginia. I regularly perform pieces such as <em>“Amazing Grace,” “Going Home,”</em> and <em>“Green Hills of Tyrol.”</em> My rate is typically $200 plus travel.</p>
                <p>With over 20 years experience as a bagpiper and performer, I have developed a large repetoire of tunes for any mood and any occasion. I am available to pipe for casual and formal events, and can appear in modern or historical (18th or 19th century) regalia. I am a former Pipe Major and a current officer in the <a href="https://wvhighlanders.github.io">West Virginia Highlanders bagpipe band</a>. I have bagpiped for weddings, funerals, monument dedications (including the WWII Memorial in Washington, D.C.), festival opening and closing ceremonies, parades, business grand openings, church services, anniversary parties, birthday celebrations, retirement parties, soldiers returning home, ceilidhs, Burns dinners, holiday parties, historical reenactment events, and many more. If you want to celebrate or memorialize with bagpipes, I can work with you to develop a set list that will work for your event. Generally available throughout West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania, but willing to travel for high-profile events or with payment to cover expenses.</p>
                <p>Families often ask: <strong>“How much does it cost to hire a bagpiper for a funeral?”</strong> My pricing is transparent, and I work directly with funeral homes to provide respectful, dignified service. I’ve been playing the bagpipes for over 20 years and understand the importance of every note played in a moment of grief or remembrance.</p>
                <p>Service areas include <strong>Clarksburg, Weston, Morgantown, Elkins, Buckhannon</strong> and more.</p>
